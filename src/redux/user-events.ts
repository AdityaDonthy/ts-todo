//https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape 
// Usually we would store an array of events in the state, but we are normalising the data here
// The basic concepts of normalizing data are:
// 1. Each type of data gets its own "table" in the state.
// 2. Each "data table" should store the individual items in an object, with the IDs of the items as keys and the items themselves as the values.
// 3. Any references to individual items should be done by storing the item's ID.
// 4. Arrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.

//Instead of maintaining an array of simple UserEvent Objects, we normalise that simple array and store it in the form a 'table'
//This let's us access it more efficiently! Like a freaking local db !!!!!!  ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ 
interface UserEventsState {
    //maintain  a dictionary of the id from the UserEvent object and the actual UserEvent Object
    // Another way of wriring this is Record<number, UserEvent>; The advantage is if the type of id changed , TS will infer this !
    byIds: Record<UserEvent['id'],UserEvent>;
    allIds: number[]
    //allIds: UserEvent['id'][]
}

const initialState: UserEventsState = {
    byIds: {},
    allIds: []
}

//Actions. What actions do is give use the API(vocab) to interact with state. Action creators generally dispatch an object, but
// we've registered thunk, we can dispatch a function which will make the network call to get the data and then dispatch the actual object

//We first define the Actions objects. We use an interface to define an object

const LOAD_SUCCESSFUL = 'userEvents/load_successful'
const LOAD_FAILURE = 'userEvents/load_failure'
