This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It can be used to record events and log the time taken to complete a event.Purpose of building this App was to playaround with Typescript.
This is a simple App built using Typescript with Redux. 
Redux uses the Redux Duck pattern
We also run a fake server using json-server library

## Functionality
User is given an option to start the timer at the beginning of the event and then stop when it ends. Kinda like a stopwatch. Please read the extensive comments in the code to understand more
